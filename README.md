# Node.js Routes & Events Practice

This repository contains hands-on practice with Node.js core concepts, focusing on **routing** and **event handling**.

## What I am learning
- **Routing**: Handling GET and POST requests, including static and dynamic routes  
- **Events**: Using Node.js EventEmitter to create, listen to, and emit custom events  

## Purpose
- To practice handling routes manually without frameworks  
- To understand Node.js’s event-driven architecture  
- To reinforce core Node.js fundamentals through practical examples  

## Status
- ✅ Static GET routes completed  
- ✅ POST routes completed  
- ✅ Dynamic routes completed  
- ✅ Event handling completed  

Explore the `routes/` and `events/` folders to see the examples in action.
