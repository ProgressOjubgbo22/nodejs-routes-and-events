# Events in Node.js

This folder contains examples of using Node.js **EventEmitter** to handle events.

## What I am learning
- How to register event listeners using `on`  
- How to trigger events using `emit`  
- How to register one-time listeners using `once`  
- How to remove event listeners using `off`  

## Purpose
- To understand Node.js's **event-driven architecture**  
- To practice creating and handling custom events  
- To see how multiple events can be managed efficiently  

## Status
- ✅ Event listener registration completed  
- ✅ Triggering events completed  
- ✅ One-time events (`once`) completed  
- ✅ Removing listeners (`off`) completed  

Open `events.js` to run and experiment with the examples.
